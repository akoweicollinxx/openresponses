# Contributing

Thanks for helping with Open Responses. This file focuses on how to make proposals.

## Proposals

We keep changes open, neutral, and interoperable, as described in `src/pages/governance.mdx`.

## Maintainers

- Lead Core Maintainer: Steve Coffey
- Core Maintainers: To be nominated

### Lead Core Maintainer selection and removal

- The Lead Core Maintainer may be removed by a 75% vote of all Core Maintainers,
  excluding the incumbent.
- If the role becomes vacant, Core Maintainers select a replacement using a
  consensus-seeking or ranked-choice method.

### When to propose

Create a proposal for any change that affects the specification, compatibility, or conformance.

### How to propose

1. Open an issue titled "Proposal: <short name>" with:
   - Problem statement and motivation
   - Proposed change (spec text or API shape)
   - Compatibility impact (breaking, additive, or clarifying)
   - Reference implementation or migration plan (if applicable)
   - Test or conformance plan
2. After initial feedback, submit a PR that includes the spec change and related docs/tests.

### How proposals are decided

We seek consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the TSC resolves the decision per the
governance charter. The Lead Core Maintainer is the final decision-maker when needed.

### DCO

All code contributions must include a Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) sign-off.
